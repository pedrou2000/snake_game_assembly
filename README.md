## 2. How to Install and Run
In order to play the game DOSBox emulator must be installed. After downloading the complete project, root of the project must be mounted using the following commands.
```console
mount C: <road_to_downloaded_project>
C:
```


Now we just have to install the drivers for the game to work and run the game. Run the following commands:
